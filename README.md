## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

As this is my first project to complete in Kotlin, I encountered many syntax errors. However, from this I was able to learn many new internal commands that made my
work much easier to compute and later troubleshoot. A specific challenge that I had was reading input from the user and later using it to formulate future
computations. Another challenge I overcame was being able to convert all lowercase characters into uppercase.
